THING TALKER
	You see the spirits in the sand, the sea and the stone. 
	You may now apply your spirit tongue, shapeshifting and 
	studied essence to inanimate natural objects (plants and rocks) 
	or creatures made thereof, as well as animals. 
	Thing-talker forms can be exact copies or can be mobile vaguely 
	humanoid-shaped entities.
