## SMOOTH MOVES

### Arcane Art
When you weave a performance into a basic spell, choose an ally and an effect: 

-  Heal 1d8 damage-  +1d4 forward to damage-  Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment-  The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1 

Then roll+CHA. 

- ✴On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. 
- ✴On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.


### Bardic Lore`A Bestiary of Creatures Unusual`When you first encounter an important creature, (your call) covered by your bardic lore you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.

### Charming and OpenWhen you speak frankly with someone, you can ask their player a question from the list below. They must answer it truthfully, then they may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer truthfully).
- Whom do you serve?- What do you wish I would do?- How can I get you to ______?- What are you really feeling right now? 
- What do you most desire?

### A Port in the StormWhen you return to a civilized settlement you’ve visited before, tell the GM when you were last here. They’ll tell you how it’s changed since then.
